# Lyric Analysis
Text analysis of songs from five genres (Pop, Hip-Hop, Country, Rock, R&amp;B) to see which references substances the most.


I decided to do something different from numnbers this time, and include some Python in the procedure. For this project, I used the genius API to download the songs for 10 different artists from 5 different genres. 

The objective is to do some text analysis in order to determine which genre makes references to drugs/substance use the most. Data collection was done using Python, while lyric extraction and data visualization was done using R.
