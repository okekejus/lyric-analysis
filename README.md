# Lyric Analysis
Text analysis of songs from five genres (Pop, Hip-Hop, Country, Rock, R&amp;B) to see which references substances the most.


I decided to do something different from numnbers this time, and include some Python in the procedure. For this project, I used the genius API to download the songs for 10 different artists from 5 different genres.

## Total words per genre

When all the lyrics were downloaded and filtered, Hip Hop was the genre with the most words, with over 20,000 in comparison to other genres:
